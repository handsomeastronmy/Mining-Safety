#### **4. Power Efficiency**

A power supplying system is to be designed so that the sensors can operate for 6 continuous months without battery replacement. The following section will discuss the power consumption calculation to choose a battery with a suitable rating.

First, the datasheets were referenced to obtain the maximum current consumption of each sensor, voltage, and sampling rate:

| **Sensor**                  | **Max Operating Current** | **Operating Voltage** | **Sampling Rate**                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **DHT11**                   | Up to **2.5 mA**          | **3 to 5.5 V**        | **1 Hz (1 reading/second)**       |
| **MQ-9**                    | Up to **150 mA**          | **5 V**               | **1 reading/hour (10s)**          |
| **Accelerometer (ADXL345)** | Up to **23 ÂµA**           | **2.5 to 5.25 V**     | **Continuous (1 reading/second)** |

Then, the active time was calculated as follows for each sensor over a day:

$$
  \text{Active Time} = \text{Number of Readings} \times \text{Duration per Reading}
$$

For the DHT11 humidity sensor, it takes one reading per minute with each reading lasting 100 milliseconds, so the calculated active time was:

$$
  \text{Active Time} = 1440 \text{ minutes/day} \times 0.1 \text{ seconds} = 144 \text{ seconds/day}
$$

For the MQ-9 sensor, given it has a heating mode that repeats itself and lasts about 10 seconds each hour and consumes the most current in this phase, the active time was:

$$
    \text{Active Time} = 24 \text{ readings} \times 10 \text{ seconds} = 240 \text{ seconds/day}
$$
   
For the Accelerometer that takes a reading every second with 1 second per reading, the active time was:

$$
    \text{Active Time} = 86400 \text{ seconds/day}
$$

Then, we estimated the daily power consumption for each sensor using the formula:

$$
\text{Daily Power Consumption (mAh)} = \left(\frac{\text{Current (mA)} \times \text{Active Time (seconds)}}{3600}\right)
$$

- **DHT11**: 
    $$ \left(\frac{2.5\,\text{mA} \times 144\,\text{s}}{3600}\right) = 0.10\,\text{mAh} $$
    
- **MQ-9**:
    $$ \left(\frac{150\,\text{mA} \times 240\,\text{s}}{3600}\right) = 10\,\text{mAh} $$

- **Accelerometer**:
    $$ \left(\frac{23\,\mu\text{A} \times 86400\,\text{s}}{3600}\right) = 0.55\,\text{mAh} $$

So, the total daily consumption is the summation of these values:

$$
\text{Total Daily Consumption} = 0.10 + 10 + 0.55 = 10.65\,\text{mAh}
$$

Given two lithium ion batteries with the same voltage and different capacities of 9900 and 6800 mAh, connecting them in parallel will result in the summation of their capacities with a total capacity of:

$$
\text{Total Capacity} = \text{Capacity of Battery 1} + \text{Capacity of Battery 2} = 9900\,\text{mAh} + 6800\,\text{mAh} = 16700\,\text{mAh}
$$

To find out the time for which the system will operate continuously, we divide the total capacity by the daily consumption:

$$
\text{Days of Operation} = \frac{\text{Total Capacity}}{\text{Daily Consumption}} = \frac{16700\,\text{mAh}}{10.65\,\text{mAh}} \approx 1568.54\,\text{days}
$$

According to these new calculations, to determine how long your 16700 mAh battery will last to power the system (DHT11, accelerometer, and MQ9 sensor), we use the following formula:

$$
\text{Battery Lifetime (hours)} = \frac{\text{Battery Capacity (mAh)}}{\text{Average Power Consumption (mA)}} = \frac{16700\,\text{mAh}}{10.65\,\text{mAh/day}} \times 24 = 37,644 \,\text{hours}
$$

We previously calculated that the total energy consumption for the system over 1 year is 98.31 Wh. Now, we need to calculate how long the battery will last based on this total energy consumption.

Step 1: Convert the battery capacity to Wh

Assuming the battery voltage is 3.3V (since the system operates at 3.3V), we can convert the 16700 mAh capacity into watt-hours (Wh):

$$
\text{Battery Capacity (Wh)} = \frac{\text{Battery Capacity (mAh)} \times \text{Voltage (V)}}{1000} = \frac{16700 \times 3.3}{1000} = 55.11 \text{ Wh}
$$

Step 2: Estimate battery lifetime

Now, let's calculate the lifetime of the battery. The total energy consumption for the system is 38.88 Wh, and the battery has a total capacity of 55.11 Wh.

$$
\text{Battery Lifetime (hours)} = \frac{55.11 \text{ Wh}}{38.88 \text{ Wh per year}} \times 8760 \text{ hours} = \frac{55.11}{38.88} \times 8760 \approx 12409.86 \text{ hours}
$$

$$
\text{Battery Lifetime (days)} = \frac{12409.86}{24} \approx 517.08 \text{ days}
$$

### Conclusion:
Your 16700 mAh battery will last approximately 517 days (about 17.2 months) powering the system (DHT11, accelerometer, and MQ9 sensor).
